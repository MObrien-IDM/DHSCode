Contribution Norms
---
1. Please make sure your code is annotated to some extent, telling the reader what sections of code are doing.
2. Try to categorize and organize your code contributions in a way that makes sense. 
3. Prioritize adding to existing folders, but make a new one if you cannot find a place where your code fits.
4. Remember that this is a user-generated repository so your mileage may vary with the code here.
5. If you find errors or updated solutions, create an issue or contribute a new file with the fix/udpated solution.
